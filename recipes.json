Big game, upland birds and waterfowl seem to be to quarry of choice for most American hunters. I suppose that doesn\u0092t upset the rabbits all that much. I suspect they would rather hang out with their buddies than in your oven. \r\nI\u0092m not quite sure why, but Americans haven\u0092t really caught on to eating rabbits. Cooked properly, they are moist, delicate and meaty. You can substitute rabbit for just about any recipe that calls for chicken. As a rule, young rabbits eat better than older ones. I\u0092ve had the best luck braising cut-up rabbits, usually with some kind of wine. The following recipe is a good example. 4 servings \r\n2 young rabbits, each cut into 6 to 8 pieces salt and freshly ground pepper 1\/2 cup all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium onion, finely diced 3 cups dry red wine 1 cup chicken broth 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon brown sugar 2 bay leaves 2 sprigs fresh rosemary 1\/2 teaspoon salt 2 firm, slightly not-quite-ripe pears; skin removed, cored and halved 3 tablespoons chilled butter \r\nSeason rabbit pieces and dust lightly with flour.

Add pears to the pan, cover and simmer for 30 minutes more. Remove rabbit and pears and arrange on plates. Remove bay leaves and rosemary from pan.

The buttermilk tenderizes the meat by breaking down this connective tissue\u0085there are other things that can be used to tenderize meat like vinegar, alcoholic beverages, powdered tenderizers and so on, but for this recipe, buttermilk works the best. The buttermilk also gives the batter a good flavor. \r\nMarinade your deer in this mixture for an hour if possible. If you don\u0092t have time or don\u0092t need to tenderize the deer meat, then just use the mustard. Remove the steaks from the marinade and wipe off the excess liquid. The Mustard is the real secret of the recipe. \r\nDredge the steaks in the flour mixture and fry them up on medium heat. Do not cook them on high heat or the mustard will caramelize too quickly and burn before the meat is done. \r\n*A simple version of this recipe is to rub French\u0092s mustard on the steaks, roll them in flour, salt and pepper and then fry them. It tastes almost as good as the fancy recipe above."}]
